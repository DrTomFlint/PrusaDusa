# PrusaDusa
These are the configuration files for the Prusa Dusa 3D printer.
Firmware is Reprap 3, controller board is a Duet 3, a Raspberry Pi 4 is attached with ribbon cable to the Duet 3.
Raspberry Pi (hostname Dusa) runs a web based control panel.
Config files are on the Pi in the system folder.

Expect to add config files for fibers, print setups, slicer stuff, any macros for tool changes, etc.
The OpenScad files to make the printer itself are in the OpenScad repo in the Dusa and Parts folders.
